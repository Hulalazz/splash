<h1 id="what-is-stochastic-algorithm">What is Stochastic Algorithm</h1>

<p>Stochastic algorithm is a family of algorithms which processes a large dataset by sequentially processing its random samples. Since their per-iteration computation cost is independent of the data size, these algorithms are very efficient in learning from large-scale data. Typical examples of stochastic algorithm include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent">Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume14/shalev-shwartz13a/shalev-shwartz13a.pdf">Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent (SDCA)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo">Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)</a></li>

  <li><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/minka/papers/ep/minka-ep-uai.pdf">Expectation Propagation</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Traditionally, stochastic algorithms are difficult to parallelize due to their sequential nature. To run these algorithms on a distributed system, there are three questions to ask:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to speedup a sequential algorithm with (inconsistent) parallel updates? </li>
  <li>How to minimize the communication cost between nodes? </li>
  <li>How to design a user-friendly programming interface for Spark users? </li>
</ul>

<p>Our simple answer is <strong>Splash</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-splash">What is Splash</h1>

<p><strong>Splash</strong> is a general-purpose framework for parallelizing stochastic algorithms on multi-node clusters. You can develop any stochastic algorithm using the Splash programming interface without knowing any detail about distributed computing. The parallelization is automatic and is communication efficient. Splash is built on <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> and <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a>, so that you can employ it to process the <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/quick-start.html">Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD)</a>.</p>

<p>On large-scale datasets, Splash can be substantially faster than existing data analytics packages based on Apache Spark. For example, to learn a 10-class logistic regression model on the <a href="http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/multiclass.html#mnist8m">mnist8m dataset</a>, The SGD algoritihm implemented via Splash is 25x faster than <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-optimization.html#l-bfgs">MLlib’s L-BFGS</a> and 75x faster than <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-optimization.html#gradient-descent-and-stochastic-gradient-descent">MLlib’s mini-batch SGD</a> for achieving the same logistic loss. All algorithms run on a 64-core cluster.</p>
